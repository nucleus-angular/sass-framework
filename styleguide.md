## Important Notes

### Code Exampels

Some code examples may have inline styles applied but this is only to simplify the examples, inline styles should **never** be done in real code.

### Visual Style Guide Only

While this framework is designed to be used with some of the Nucleus Angular components, you can also use this framework what JavaScript components you want as long as they generate the proepr DOM structure.  This style guide only provides a visual guide to what this framework can offer and does not utilize the Nucleus Angular components.  Minor custom JavaScript has been written only for the locations that absolutely need it.

### Icons

This framework is designed with SVG based icons.  SVG based icons are supported in modern browser (the framework does not consider IE 8 a modern browser) and generally look better and more consistent on all browsers than icon fonts.

## Nucleus Angular SASS Framework

The Nucleus Angular SASS Framework is a SASS framework that is disigned as a start point for use with the Nucleus Angular components.  While this is designed to be used with the Nucleus Angular compoenents, it can be used on it's own.  Some of the key point are:

- Uses a slightly modified version of Normalize.css as it based
- A minimalist framework that provides the basic building blocks (but for example doesn't deal with layout at all)
- It has a flat UI (you won't see shadows, gradients, etc...) however it would be easy enough for you to add that your if you wanted
- Should look good on desktop and mobile
- Works with FireFox, Chrome, iOS, Android, and IE 9+
